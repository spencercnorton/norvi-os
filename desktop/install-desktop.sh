# paints an opaque background of its own -- so the blur is sampled, composited
# and then completely hidden. Pure GPU cost, no pixels.
#
# NOT a fix for the broken extensions/app menus reported on Chrome and Brave.
# Those are popups, and check_blur() filters on frame type
# [NORMAL, DIALOG, MODAL_DIALOG], so blur-my-shell never touched them. The
# popover rules in gtk4.css were also cleared: rendered against a plain GTK4
# app they produce a correct dark plate, so they are not it either.

# RESOLVED 2026-08-23. It was the third candidate this comment named -- Chromium
# sampling GTK for colours it paints itself, `window.background` handing it our
# 0.72 alpha for a colour it treats as opaque. Measured by toggling ONLY Brave's
# `system_theme` between 1 (GTK) and 0 (Classic) against a geolocation prompt
# over a text page: on GTK the page's own heading read straight through the
# bubble, on Classic it did not.
#
# This comment also concluded that half "cannot be fixed here; it is Brave's own
# Appearance setting". That was wrong. There is no per-app selector, but there
# does not need to be -- Chromium samples from a GtkWindow it never realizes and
# GTK adds `csd` in realize, so `window.background.csd` in gtk4.css is invisible
# to the sampler and still reaches every real window. See that rule's header for
# the probe. The blacklist below stays: it is a separate, GPU-cost-only argument.
